#Homework for September 25, 2013

##Calculator 1
Create a command line calculator. It should have a basic and advanced mode.

* basic calculator (+, -, *, /)
* advanced calculator (exponents, square root)

* For a basic calculator, press 1.  
* For an advanced calculator, press 2. To quit, press Q.  
* For calculators, first enter type of calculation, then enter 2 numbers.  

Create methods for each operation, and each one to show and interact with a text menu.

##Calculator 2

Add a trip calculator to your program. Ask the user (politely) for four inputs:

**Distance** – how far will you drive?  
**MPG** – what is the fuel efficiency of the car?  
**$PG** – how much does gas cost per gallon?  
**Speed** – how fast will you drive?  

Your output is a string: “Your trip will take 3.5 hours and cost $255.33.”

Add this as a menu choice.


##Bonus

Add two more sets of calculators. These should be accessible from your menu method that you created in Calculator 1.

* [BMI:](http://www.wikihow.com/Image:BMI.jpg)
